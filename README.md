# SLP Token Icons

A hosted repository of all known SLP token icons. All tokens added here will be served via an extremely censorship resistant endpoint located at tokens.bch.sx/`[size]`/`[txid]`.png

## Usage

The format is tokens.bch.sx/`{size}`/`{txid}`.`{format}`

`{size}` can be any number from 1-2399 (or "original")

`{txid}` is the transaction id of the token genesis transaction

`{format}` can be png, jpg, tiff or webp

## Adding your icon

Create a version of your icon in 32x32, 64x64, 128x128 and "original" (more than or equal to 128px) and add them to their respective folders in a pull request. If you have a SVG file, feel free to add that to.

Alternatively open an issue or contact me on [telegram](https://t.me/kosinusbch) with links to an icon in at least 128x128 and I'll resize them for you.
